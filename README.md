# Project-practice
 A practice project (will be renamed later)

## TODO
- Need to implement a head class that is inserting everything
- Need to think of hierarchy of how it's going to be working with the db (install, create, get, insert etc)
- Need to rethink how Title is going to work (maybe another class or function)
- Need to create child classes for getting db and checking if tables are spooled and populated

### v.1.0.0
- Created dbinstall and create_db classes
- Create database automatically with jSon (db-info.json) over dbinstall class
- Create file structure
