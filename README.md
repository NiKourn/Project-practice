# Project-practice
 A practice project (will be renamed later)

## TODO
- Need to create child classes for getting db and checking if tables are spooled and populated, need to think of hierarchy of how it's going to be working with the db (install, create, get, insert etc)
- Need to implement a head class that is inserting everything
- Need to rethink how Title is going to work (maybe another class or function)

### v.1.0.0
- Created dbinstall and create_db classes
- Create database automatically with jSon (db-info.json) over dbinstall class
- Create file structure
